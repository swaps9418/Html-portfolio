<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Scintillating movie and keeps you engaged till the end. Maybe confusing for some, but its a masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Shawshank redemption</h3>
<p>Masterpiece no.2! What a movie! Great performance by all actors. Love it!</p>
<h3>City of god</h3>
<p>Its a regional movie. Tale of 2 friends who change their paths coming from modest/poor background and turning into gangsters growing up.Surely a recommendation</p>
